# 📘 Functions in C++ — Complete Guide

## 📌 What is a Function?

A **function** in C++ is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
Instead of writing the same logic again and again, we write it once inside a function and reuse it.

Functions help in:
- Code reusability  
- Better program structure  
- Easy debugging  
- Clean and readable code  

Old-school rule that still matters:
> Break large programs into small logical functions.

### ✅ Function Declaration  
Tells the compiler that a function exists.

```cpp
int add(int, int);
