# Find Missing and Repeated Values
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. 
Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. 
The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.

 * Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].

* Example 2:
Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
Output: [9,5]
Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMissingAndRepeatedValues(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {

        vector<int> ans;
        unordered_set<int> s;
        int n = grid.size();

        int a, b;
        int actualSum = 0;
        int expectedSum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {

                actualSum += grid[i][j];

                if (s.find(grid[i][j]) != s.end()) {

                    a = grid[i][j];
                    ans.push_back(a);
                }

                s.insert(grid[i][j]);
            }
        }

        expectedSum = (n * n) * (n * n + 1) / 2;
        b = expectedSum + a - actualSum;
        ans.push_back(b);

        return ans;
    }
};

```
